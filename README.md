# Implementations of Computing Patterns in Parsl

This repository houses important examples and implementations of computing patterns and workflows in Parsl. The jupyter notebooks are meant to provide a template that engineers and scientists can use to build their own parallel workflows.

The topics covered in these implementations are: 

1. Basic functions and patterns.
2. Sequences, Loops and Routing.
3. Recursion.
4. Monte-Carlo Simulations
5. Mathematical models and estimation algorithms.
