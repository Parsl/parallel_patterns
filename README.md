# Implementations of Computing Patterns in Parsl

Parsl is a parallel scripting package in Python.

This repository houses important examples and implementations of computing patterns and workflows in Parsl for data management, mathematical models, computing techniques and simulations. The jupyter notebooks are meant to provide a template that engineers and scientists can use to build their own parallel workflows.

The topics covered in these implementations are: 

1. [Sequences, Loops and Routing.](https://github.com/Parsl/parallel_patterns/blob/master/Sequences%20and%20Loops.ipynb)
2. [Data Handling Workflows](https://github.com/Parsl/parallel_patterns/blob/master/Data%20Handling%20Workflows.ipynb)
3. [Monte-Carlo Simulations](https://github.com/Parsl/parallel_patterns/blob/master/Monte-Carlo%20Simulations.ipynb)
4. [Mathematical Technique](https://github.com/Parsl/parallel_patterns/blob/master/Mathematical%20Techniques.ipynb)
5. [Montage Mosaic](https://github.com/Parsl/parallel_patterns/blob/master/Montage%20Mosaic.ipynb)
